This is a copy (probably a bad one) of a raspberry pi unifi install script . I went through and made it work for my situation only. I did a fresh install of Debion 11 headless. I figured with all the headaches I went through to figure this out, I could at least share it with someone. More so if in the future I needed to do it again.

If this works for you, awesome!!!
