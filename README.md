This is a collection of some random scripts that I got tired of doing over and over.  They are pretty specific to what I'm working on, but if they work for you, great!!


This does an install of docker as recommended from the docker website.  Only been tested on deb 12. 
```bash
sudo wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mellow65/Debian-11-Unifi/main/Deb-12-docker.sh" -O Deb-12-docker.sh && sudo chmod +x Deb-12-docker.sh && ./Deb-12-docker.sh
```


This one will run a backup of your immich docker so it can be restored on another machine. 
```bash
sudo wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mellow65/Debian-11-Unifi/main/immich-backup.sh" -O immich-backup.sh && sudo chmod +x immich-backup.sh && ./immich-backup.sh
```



This one restores your immich config file to a new machine or docker configuration.
```bash
sudo wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mellow65/Debian-11-Unifi/main/restore-immich.sh" -O restore-immich.sh && sudo chmod +x restore-immich.sh && ./restore-immich.sh
```
